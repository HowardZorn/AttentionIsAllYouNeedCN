% Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory \citep{hochreiter1997} and gated recurrent \citep{gruEval14} neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation \citep{sutskever14, bahdanau2014neural, cho2014learning}. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures \citep{wu2016google,luong2015effective,jozefowicz2016exploring}.

循环神经网络，特别是长短期记忆\citep{hochreiter1997}和门控循环\citep{gruEval14}神经网络，已经被牢固地确立为语言建模和机器翻译等序列建模和转换问题的最先进方法\citep{sutskever14, bahdanau2014neural, cho2014learning}。此后，众多的努力不断拓宽着循环神经网络语言模型和编码器-解码器架构的边界\citep{wu2016google,luong2015effective,jozefowicz2016exploring}。

% Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_t$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

RNN模型通常按输入和输出序列的符号顺序进行参数计算。在计算时，将这些位置与步长对齐，生成一个隐藏状态$h_t$的序列，作为前一个隐藏状态$h_{t-1}$和位置$t$的输入的函数。这种固有的顺序性排除了训练实例内的并行化，这在较长的序列长度上变得至关重要，因为内存约束限制了跨实例的批处理。

% Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks \citep{Kuchaiev2017Factorization} and conditional computation \citep{shazeer2017outrageously}, while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.

最近的工作通过因式化技巧\citep{Kuchaiev2017Factorization}和条件计算\citep{shazeer2017outrageously}实现了计算效率的显著提高，同时也提高了后者情况下的模型性能。然而，顺序计算的基本约束仍然存在。

%\marginpar{@all: there is work on analyzing what attention really does in seq2seq models, couldn't find it right away} 

% Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences \citep{bahdanau2014neural, structuredAttentionNetworks}. In all but a few cases \citep{decomposableAttnModel}, however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.

注意机制已经成为各种任务中引人注目的序列建模和转导模型的一个组成部分，允许对依赖关系进行建模，而不考虑它们在输入或输出序列中的距离\citep{bahdanau2014neural, structuredAttentionNetworks}。然而，除了少数情况外，\citep{decomposableAttnModel}，这种注意力机制都是与RNN一起使用的。

%\marginpar{not sure if "cross-positional communication" is understandable without explanation}
%\marginpar{insert exact training times and stats for the model that reaches sota earliest, maybe even a single GPU model?}

% In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

在这项工作中，我们提出了Transformer，一个摒弃RNN的模型架构，而完全依靠注意力机制来绘制输入和输出之间的全局依赖关系。Transformer允许更多的并行化，并且在8个P100 GPU上训练12小时后，就可以在翻译质量上达到一个新的水平。

%\marginpar{you removed the constant number of repetitions part. I wrote it because I wanted to make it clear that the model does not only perform attention once, while it's also not recurrent. I thought that might be important to get across early.}

% Just a standard paragraph with citations, rewrite.
%After the seminal papers of \citep{sutskever14}, \citep{bahdanau2014neural}, and \citep{cho2014learning}, recurrent models have become the dominant solution for both sequence modeling and sequence-to-sequence transduction. Many efforts such as \citep{wu2016google,luong2015effective,jozefowicz2016exploring} have pushed the boundaries of machine translation and language modeling with recurrent sequence models. Recent effort \citep{shazeer2017outrageously} has combined the power of conditional computation with sequence models to train very large models for machine translation, pushing SOTA at lower computational cost. Recurrent models compute a vector of hidden states $h_t$, for each time step $t$ of computation. $h_t$ is a function of both the input at time $t$ and the previous hidden state $h_t$. This dependence on the previous hidden state encumbers recurrnet models to process multiple inputs at once, and their time complexity is a linear function of the length of the input and output, both during training and inference. [What I want to say here is that although this is fine during decoding, at training time, we are given both input and output and this linear nature does not allow the RNN to process all inputs and outputs simultaneously and haven't been used on datasets that are the of the scale of the web. What's the largest dataset we have ? . Talk about Nividia and possibly other's effors to speed up things, and possibly other efforts that alleviate this, but are still limited by it's comptuational nature]. Rest of the intro: What if you could construct the state based on the actual inputs and outputs, then you could construct them all at once. This has been the foundation of many promising recent efforts, bytenet,facenet (Also talk about quasi rnn here). Now we talk about attention!! Along with cell architectures such as long short-term meory (LSTM) \citep{hochreiter1997}, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) \citep{cho2014learning}, attention has emerged as an essential ingredient in successful sequence models, in particular for machine translation. In recent years, many, if not all, state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in machine translation have been achieved with attention-based sequence models \citep{wu2016google,luong2015effective,jozefowicz2016exploring}. Talk about the neon work on how it played with attention to do self attention! Then talk about what we do.
